Java Programming II – MOOC Exercises

This repository contains all the exercises I completed during the **Java Programming II** course offered by the University of Helsinki through the MOOC.fi platform.
This second part of the series builds upon the fundamentals from **Java Programming I** and dives deeper into advanced programming concepts, including:

- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Interfaces and abstract classes
- Exception handling
- File I/O (reading and writing files)
- Collections framework (Lists, Sets, Maps)
- Generics
- Streams and functional programming basics
- More advanced object-oriented programming patterns

Each folder represents a module or week from the course. Inside, you’ll find the exercises and solutions I submitted via the TMC system.

Attached below is my certificate for completing this part of the course.
